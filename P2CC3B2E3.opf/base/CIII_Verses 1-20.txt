Great King, hear how from the great scriptures of the MahāyānaThe marks of a Buddha arise from
merit inconceivable.

The merits which creates all Solitary Realisers, Learners and Non-LearnersAnd all the merit
of the transient world is measureless like the universe itself.

Through such merit ten times extended one hair-pore of a Buddha is achieved;All the hair-pores
of a Buddha arise in just the same way.

Through multiplying by a hundred the merit which producesAll the hair-pores of a Buddha one
auspicious minor mark is won.

O King, as much merit as is required for one auspicious minor mark,So much is required for each
up to the eightieth.

Through multiplying by a hundred the collection of merit which achievesThe eighty auspicious
minor marks one major sign of a great being arises.

Through multiplying by a thousand the extensive merit which is the causeOf achieving the thirty
minor signs the hair-treasure like a full moon arises.

Through multiplying by a hundred thousand the merit for the hair-treasureA protector’s crown-protrusion
is produced, imperceptible [as to size].

Though such merit is measureless for brevity it is said to have a measureAnd all of it is said
to be ten times the merit of the world.

When the causes of even the Form Body of a Buddha are immeasurableAs the world, how then could
the causes of the Body of Truth be measured.

If the causes of all things are small but they produce extensive effects,The thought that the
measureless causes of Buddhahood have measurable effects must be eliminated.

The Form Body of a Buddha arises from collected merit,The Body of Truth in brief, O King, arises
from collected wisdom.

Thus these two collections cause Buddhahood to be attained,So in brief always rely upon merit
and wisdom.

Do not be lazy about this [amassing] of merit to achieve enlightenmentSince reasoning and scripture
can restore one’s spirits.

Just as all directions space, earth, water, fire and windAre without limit, so suffering sentient
beings are limitless.

The Bodhisattvas through their compassion lead these limitless sentient beingsOut of suffering
and establish them definitely in Buddhahood.

Whether sleeping or not sleeping, after thoroughly assuming [such compassion]He who remains
steadfast, even though he might become non-consciouentious,

Always accumulates merit as limitless as all sentient beings, for their number has no limit.Know
then that since [the causes] are limitless limitless Buddhahood is not hard to attain.

[A Bodhisattva] stays for a limitless time [in the world], for limitless embodied beings he
seeksThe limitless [qualities of] enlightenment and performs virtuous actions without limit.

Though enlightenment is limitless, how could he not attain itWith these four limitless collections
wihtout being delayed for long?

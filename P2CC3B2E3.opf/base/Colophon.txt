Here ends the Precious Garland of Advice for the King by the great teacher, the Superior, Nāgārjuna.
It was [first] translated by the Indian Abbot Vidyākāraprabhā and the Tibetan translator
monk Pel-tsek (dPal-brtsegs). Consulting three Sanskrit editions, the Indian abbot
Śīkanakavarma and the Tibetan monk Pa-tsap-nyi-ma-drak (Pa-tshab-ñi-ma-grags) corrected mistranslations
and other points which did not accord with the particular thought of the Superior
[Nāgārjuna] and his ‘son’ [Āryadeva]. It was printed at the great publishing house
below [the Potala in Lhasa].
